                    Two Agilex Limo Pro platforms were used to simulate intelligent connected vehicles in a real-world scenario. 
                    One platform served as the ego vehicle equipped with the algorithm, while the other acted as an obstacle vehicle. 
                    The testing was conducted on a circular roadway with a width of 0.9 meters, allowing two vehicles to drive side by 
                    side and providing space for lane changing and overtaking maneuvers. For position tracking, we utilized the 
                    FZMOTION MOTION CAPTURE SYSTEM. The entire testing system was based on ROS (Robot Operating System) and deployed 
                    on an Ubuntu 20.04 system. The vehicle dimensions were 0.32 meters in length and 0.20 meters in width, with a maximum 
                    speed limit set to 0.7 m/s.

                            In complex traffic environments, autonomous vehicles must simultaneously cope with multi-source potential
                            risks arising from road boundaries, lane structures, and both
                            dynamic and static traffic participants. These risks interact
                            and overlap across spatial and temporal dimensions, increasing
                            the safety challenges of trajectory planning. Existing methods
                            face limitations in handling high-dimensional obstacle avoidance
                            constraints and dynamic environmental factors, often resulting
                            in degraded trajectory quality and reduced safety. To overcome
                            these challenges, this paper proposes a safety-enhanced trajectory
                            planning method, which improves trajectory quality through the
                            recursive generation of the Spatio-Temporal Risk Map (STRM)
                            and the Dynamic Safety Corridor (DSC). First, based on potential
                            field theory, a risk modeling approach is applied to various
                            traffic elements, such as road boundaries, lane markings, and
                            both dynamic and static obstacles, to generate the STRM,
                            thereby mapping the traffic environment information into a
                            unified risk space. Subsequently, a method for constructing the
                            DSC is proposed, considering boundary risk thresholds. This
                            approach effectively decouples the relationship between complex
                            environmental factors and driving tasks, thereby simplifying
                            collision constraints. Finally, an Optimal Control Problem (OCP)
                            is formulated, taking into account factors such as trajectory
                            smoothness, comfort, and collision risk, in order to generate
                            optimized trajectories that meet both safety and feasibility requirements. The effectiveness of the proposed method in various
                            multi-lane scenarios was evaluated through simulation experiments. The results show that the proposed method significantly
                            enhances the safety of trajectory planning, especially in highly
                            dynamic and high-risk environments..

                    real-time with a simulated roadside computation unit carried by a quadrotor UAV. The LIMO robots
                    send task waypoints and real-time state information to the UAV, which runs the proposed
                    collaborative spatiotemporal trajectory optimization algorithm and returns parameterized
                    trajectories to each vehicle for execution. The LIMOs follow the generated trajectories using

                    <strong>Fig. 15:</strong> The top image shows snapshots from 70 to 74 seconds of the ego vehicle 
                    performing an overtaking maneuver in the circular roadway, demonstrating that the ego vehicle overtakes 
                    the obstacle vehicle from the left lane. The middle image illustrates the real-time risk variation and 
                    corresponding safety corridor as the ego vehicle moves, where the contour colors of the ego and obstacle 
                    vehicles are independent of the risk color. The boundaries of the safety corridor are dynamically adjusted 
                    based on the ego vehicle's speed and the risk threshold, ensuring the safety of the ego vehicle during the 
                    overtaking process. As the ego vehicle's speed increases, the safety corridor contracts in both the lateral 
                    and longitudinal directions, effectively distancing the ego vehicle from the obstacle during the overtaking 
                    maneuver. The bottom image presents the vehicle path and variations in longitudinal and lateral velocities 
                    within a 90-second time frame, with a speed of zero between 40s and 50s due to manual adjustments to the position, 
                    ensuring that the obstacle vehicle remains in front of the ego vehicle to better serve as an interference. 
                    Additionally, the minimum distance chart shows the relative distance between the ego vehicle and the obstacle over time, 
                    demonstrating that the distance between the ego and the obstacle is consistently maintained within a safe range throughout 
                    the experiment, even during the overtaking maneuver, thus ensuring no collision due to excessive proximity.
